Hence, ``L394``'s immediate bonded neighbor, ``L393``, only gets a bar when ``n=0`` (no excuded neighbors, blue bar). Accordingly, next the residue after that, ``E392``, only gets a bar with ``n=0`` or ``n=1``, else it's excluded. Since ``L393`` is covalently bonded to ``L394``, and ``L392`` is covalently bonded to ``L392``, there's a strong expectation for these residue to be near each other, so these frequencies are not very informative. If you're wondering what's with positions 390 and 391, there's a bend in the C-terminus of the alpha helix 5 (``TYR391`` points away from ``L394`` throughout the simulation) so they do not appear on the report regardless.\n",

    "   Meaning, just 73 contacts out of 137 contacts (i.e. roughly the upper half of the table) already capture 90% of everything there is to report. You could *throw away* the second half of the entries of the contact list and **still** keep 90% of the total frequency there is to report. The *running* value of $\\Sigma$ as you move to the right on the plot is represented with fainted gray line that grows between 0 and 1. You can see that in the middle of the plot it already reaches high values. \n",
    "3. Finally, `mdciao` informs the user of the frequency value of that last contact at 90%. In this case, that value (0.57 i.e.  57%) is, in this case, too high to be discarded.   \n",
    "   While truncating the list at 90% seems a reasonable way to focus on the relevant frequencies, that would mean discarding some contacts that are formed slightly below 50% of the time (see the graph).\n",

The *long tail* is contained in the above report, nevertheless:"
